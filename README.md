# Machine_learning
## Overveiw
This project aims to suggest the most suitable career path for students based on their academic performance, skills, and other relevant factors. By leveraging machine learning models, this system can provide personalized recommendations to help students make informed decisions about their future careers.

## **Data**
You can get data [HERE](https://github.com/loobiish/Student-Career-Prediction)

## **Libraries**
Use pip to install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt.
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
## **Our Model**
we have followed some step to creat model:  
**Step one: data preprocessig**
Data didn't need much processes:
* Checking any missing data.
* Checking any duplicated data and delete them.
* Making feature extruction and feature engineering: megering the similar features in one feature.

**Step two: Build the model**
We have used the machine learning classification (Random Forst) because this model made the best accuracy and recall.  

**Evaluation**
We have used to this:
* Accuracy: 0.8947368421052632
* Precision: 0.85
* Recall: 0.875
* F1 Score: 0.8571428571428571
